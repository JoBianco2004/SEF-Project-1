  "text": "Drone Project\nBy Nicholas Taylor\nTeams:\nGroup 1: Security – Prevent and defend against hacking attempts. These can be done through physical if they obtain access to a drone, through Wi-Fi attacks, RF attacks, GPS attacks, etc. Apply  Zero Trust model.\n\nGroup 2: Resilience – Prevent and overcome communication interruptions, hardware failures, software failures, etc. Create contingencies, countermeasures, redundancies, etc. Try to eliminate any SPOF (Single Point of Failure) that you can.\n\t\t\t\tZero Trust Model\nThe main ideology of the Zero Trust Model is: ​\nA small compromise you make in trust can cause; disasters huge financial losses, etc.​\nApplying Zero Trust Model:\nTreat devices on a network like strangers, they must prove their identity before you can trust them.\nIf something can be exploited, someone will exploit it.\n\n\t     Eliminating Single Points of Failure\n“A 'Single Point of Failure' refers to a vulnerable component in a system that, if it fails, can cause the entire system to fail. ” (sciencedirect.com)\n\nCommon strategies of eliminating and reducing points of failure:\nRedundancies – If a technology goes down, have another in its place\nContingencies – Have a backup plan \nCountermeasures – Actively take measures when needed reduce interruptions\nDamage control – If something goes wrong, minimize resulting damages \n\n\nHow to get started:\nAll Groups: \nRead the ICCCN paper\u000b\nGroup 1:\n\nFind vulnerabilities in the current configuration. If something isn’t specified, assume it isn’t implemented.\n\nGroup 2:\nLook at what could go wrong with the current configuration and think of worst-case scenarios. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tCurrent configuration\nHow could this configuration be sabotaged  and what could go wrong? How about the sensors on the drone? What could happen during a sabotage?\n"
