to scan networks for vulnerabilities\nSecurity procedures can provide a network environment with more secure computing\n5\nBasics of Assessing a System\nKnowing how to begin securing a system can be daunting\nThe stages of assessing a system’s security can be categorized into the six Ps:\nPatch – check and keep system patches up to date\nPorts – shut down any unneeded ports\nProtect – implement a firewall and IDS\nPolicies – enforce written policies on computer security\nProbe – regularly probe network for security flaws\nPhysical – use policies for securing server rooms, individual workstations, and other physical equipment\n6\nSecuring Computer Systems\nSome organizations offer step-by-step guides or security templates for use in your network setting:\nNational Security Agency\nSee https://nsacyber.github.io/publications.html \nCenter for Internet Security (CIS)\nSee https://www.cisecurity.org\nSANS Institute\nSee www.sans.org/resources/policies/\nTemplates for implementing security precautions:\nWindows security templates\nSee https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/816585\n7\nSecuring Computer Systems (cont.)\nSecuring individual workstations\nApply all patches\nRestrict the ability to install programs or alter system settings\nInstall antivirus and antispyware software\nConfigure firewalls\nEnforce the use of secure passwords\nSecuring a server\nFollow the same steps as for workstations, plus…\nEnable operating system logging and review logs periodically\nBack up data on a regular basis (daily is preferred); store backup tapes in an offsite location\nUninstall or shut down unneeded services\n8\nSecuring Computer Systems (cont.)\nSecuring a network\nSecure all computers that comprise the network\nUse a firewall, proxy server, and IDS\nPartition a large network into smaller segments with a firewall-enabled router between segments\nSeparate web servers from the rest of the network\nThe web server should only include operating system and web server software (and optionally, an IDS)\nConsider using a DMZ, which involves two firewalls: one outer and one inner (see the next slide)\n9\nDMZ (Demilitarized Zone)\n10\nScanning Your Network\nTo keep a network secure, routinely check the network for vulnerabilities and flaws\nCommon vulnerability scanners include:\nNESSUS – the premiere network vulnerability scanner\nOWASP Zap – the standard for web application vulnerability\nShodan – used by black hat hackers and security professionals\nKali Linux – Linux distribution with open-source tools for cybersecurity, digital forensics, and penetration testing\nVega – free, open-source scanner for web applications\nOpenVAS – open-source vulnerability scanner that includes several services and tools\n11\nTesting and Scanning Standards\nThere are specific standards that relate to vulnerability scans and penetration tests\nCommon testing and scanning standards include:\nNIST 800-115 – general guide for testing and assessment\nNSA-IAM – excellent guide for penetration tests\nPCI DSS – standard used by major credit card companies\nNational Vulnerability Database\nU.S. government repository of vulnerability data\nUses the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)\n12\nGetting Professional Help\nIf it’s necessary to hire outside help to set up and test your system’s security, consider these guidelines for finding a qualified individual:\nCertification\nCNE, MCITP, CISSP, Security+, CASP, GAIC, Cisco, and others\nEducation\nDegree in computer science, engineering, computer information systems, or security\nExperience\nMinimum of 5 years IT experience, with 2 years security\nBackground Checks\nReferences, credit check, criminal background check\n13\nSummary\nPeriodically assess a network or system for security vulnerabilities\nWeekly for high-security sites\nQuarterly for noncritical or low-security sites\nSafe computing involves securing all computers, networks, and servers, and using common sense on the Web\nApply security practices and standards to all aspects of network systems\n14\nModule 4 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability

different approaches are used in cybersecurity and cybersecurity education\nPracticed as a business management discipline\nApproached as a computer science sub-discipline\nWide range of technical backgrounds and skill sets for practitioners\nCybersecurity can be viewed as an engineering discipline—a sub-discipline of systems engineering\n37\nDefining Cybersecurity Engineering\nCybersecurity and Systems Engineering\nCybersecurity involves diverse computer systems, human processes, operating systems, and more\nCybersecurity could be considered a sub-discipline of systems engineering\nSystems engineering is concerned with a given system, or system of systems, throughout the system life cycle\nBegins with the concept phase and continues through system disposal\nThis is an appropriate approach for cybersecurity engineering\n38\nDefining Cybersecurity Engineering\nApplying Engineering to Cybersecurity\nA cybersecurity project should begin by defining the requirements\nUse the SMART acronym for effective requirements:\nSpecific\nMeasurable\nAchievable\nRealistic\nTimely\nA tool to aid in planning is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), which breaks a project into smaller tasks; see the next slide for an example\n\n39\nWork Breakdown Structure\n40\nStandards\nEvery engineering discipline has specific standards\nStandards in the cybersecurity industry include:\nRMF: Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework\nISO 27001: Standard for Information Security Management System (ISMS)\nISO 27004: How to Measure Information Security\nNIST SP 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines\n41\nModeling\nCybersecurity engineering is directed toward some threat\nModeling ensures you are building your security to counter the threats specific to your systems\nDifferent modeling concepts include:\nSTRIDE: Identifies threats in six categories\nPASTA: Risk-centric seven-step methodology\nDREAD: Mnemonic for risk rating using five categories\n\n42\nSummary\nThere are various applications of systems engineering to cybersecurity\nThe goal is to apply a methodical, systematic approach to cybersecurity\nPenetration testing should be a carefully engineered process mapped to specific testing requirements\nIt is beneficial to model cybersecurity scenarios to better understand system security requirements\n43\nModule 4 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning\nDigital Forensics\nCybersecurity Engineering\nSecurity policies\nFirewalls\nAuthentication, Access controls\nFederated trust\nIoT/Cloud middleware\nIT Security Management Controls\n44\nSecurity Control\n45\nControl is defined as:\n\n“An action, device, procedure, or other measure that reduces risk by eliminating or preventing a security violation, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it to enable corrective action.”\n\n\nControl Classifications\n46\nManagement controls\nFocus on security policies, planning, guidelines, and standards that influence the selection of operational and technical controls to reduce the risk of loss and to protect the organization’s mission\nThese controls refer to issues that management needs to address\nOperational controls\nAddress the correct implementation and use of security policies and standards, ensuring consistency in security operations and correcting identified operational deficiencies\nThese controls relate to mechanisms and procedures that are primarily implemented by people rather than systems\nThey are used to improve the security of a system or group of systems\nTechnical controls\nInvolve the security policies on correct use of hardware and software security capabilities in systems\nThese range from simple to complex measures that work together to secure critical and sensitive data, information, and IT systems functions\n\nNIST SP800-53 Security Controls \n47\nDetailed Security Controls \n48\nDetailed Security Controls (2) \n49\nDetailed Security Controls (3) \n50\nTechnical Security Controls\n51\nIT Security Plan\n52\nProvides details of:\nWhat will be done\nWhat resources are needed\nWho is responsible\nGoal is to detail the actions needed to improve the identified deficiencies in the risk profile\n\n\nSecurity Plan Implementation\n53\nSecurity Plan Implementation (2)\n54\nSecurity Plan Implementation Follow-up\n55\nSecurity management is a cyclic process\nConstantly repeated to respond to changes in the IT systems and the risk environment\nNeed to monitor implemented controls\nEvaluate changes for security implications\t\nOtherwise increase chance of security breach\nSecurity Plan Maintenance\n56\nNeed continued maintenance and monitoring of implemented controls to ensure continued correct functioning and appropriateness\nGoal is to ensure controls perform as intended\n\n\n57\nModule 4 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning\nDigital Forensics\nCybersecurity Engineering\nSecurity policies\nFirewalls\nAuthentication, Access controls\nFederated trust\nIoT/Cloud middleware\nThe Need For Firewalls\n58\nInternet connectivity is essential\nHowever it creates a threat\n\nEffective means of protecting LANs\n\nInserted between the premises network and the Internet to establish a controlled link\nCan be a single computer system or a set of two or more systems working together\n\nUsed as a perimeter defense\nSingle choke point to impose security and auditing \nInsulates the internal systems from external networks\n\nFirewall Characteristics\n59\nDesign Goals:\nAll traffic from inside to outside, and vice versa, must pass through the firewall\n\nOnly authorized traffic as defined by the local security policy will be allowed to pass\n\nThe firewall itself is immune to penetration\nNot always true\n\nThe firewall of a large-sized enterprise network can typically have a ruleset or ACL (Access Control List) comprising 10K+ rules\nLast-matching rules are located at the bottom of the ruleset and consume the most CPU processing power of firewalls\nIf these rules get discovered by an attacker, the attacker can effectively launch a low-rate DoS attack that can bring the firewall to its knees\nCountermeasures: Random delay, periodic re-arranging of rules or caching\n\n\n\nK. Salah, K. Sattar, A. Baig, M. Squalli, P. Calyam, “Resiliency of Popular Network Firewalls against Remote Discovery of Last-Matching Rules”, ACM Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN), 2009.\nFirewall Access Policy\n60\nA critical component in the planning and implementation of a firewall is specifying a suitable access policy\nThis lists the types of traffic authorized to pass through the firewall\nIncludes address ranges, protocols, applications and content types\n\nThis policy should be developed from the organization’s information security risk assessment and policy\n\nShould be developed from a broad specification of which traffic types the organization needs to support\nThen refined to detail the filter elements which can then be implemented within an appropriate firewall topology\n\n\n\nFirewall Filter Characteristics\n61\nCharacteristics that a firewall access policy could use to filter traffic include (as per NIST SP 800-41):\n\n\nFirewall Capabilities and Limits\n62\nCapabilities:\n\tDefines a single choke point\n\tProvides a location for monitoring security events\n\tConvenient platform for several Internet functions that are not security related\n\tCan serve as the platform for IPSec\nIPSec is a standard suite of protocols between 2 communication points across the IP network that provide data authentication, integrity, and confidentiality; It also defines the encrypted, decrypted and authenticated packets\n\nLimitations:\n\tCannot protect against attacks bypassing firewall\n\tMay not protect fully against internal threats\n\tImproperly secured wireless LAN can be accessed from outside the organization\n\tLaptop, or portable storage device may be infected outside the corporate network then used internally\n\n\n\nTypes of Firewalls\n63\nTypes of Firewalls (2)\n64\nPacket Filtering Firewall\n65\nApplies rules to each incoming and outgoing IP packet \nTypically a list of rules based on matches in the IP or TCP header\nForwards or discards the packet based on rules match\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo default policies:\nDiscard - prohibit unless expressly permitted\nMore conservative, controlled, visible to users\nForward - permit unless expressly prohibited\nEasier to manage and use but less secure\n\n\n\n\nPacket Filtering Examples\n66\nDo you see problems with this rule set?\nRule 4 allows external traffic to any destination port above 1023. As an example of an exploit of this rule, an\nexternal attacker can open a connection from the attacker’s port 5150 to an internal Web proxy server on port 8080. This is supposed to be forbidden and could allow an attack on the server.\n\nTo counter this attack, the firewall rule set can be configured with a source port field for each row. For rules 2 and 4, the source port is set to 25; for rules 1 and 3, the source port is set to >1023.\n\nPacket Filtering Advantages and Weaknesses\n67\nAdvantages:\nSimplicity\nTypically transparent to users and are very fast\n\nWeaknesses:\nCannot prevent attacks that employ application specific vulnerabilities or functions\nLimited logging functionality\nDo not support advanced user authentication\nVulnerable to attacks on TCP/IP protocol bugs\nImproper configuration can lead to breaches\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Firewalls\n68\nStateful Inspection Firewall\n69\nExample Stateful Firewall Connection State\n70\nTypes of Firewalls (2)\n71\nApplication-Level Gateway\n72\nAlso called an application proxy\n\nActs as a relay of application-level traffic\nUser contacts gateway using a TCP/IP application\nUser is authenticated\nGateway contacts application on remote host and relays TCP segments between server and user\n\nMust have proxy code for each application\nMay restrict application features supported\n\nTend to be more secure than packet filters\n\nDisadvantage is the additional processing overhead on each connection\n\n\n\n\nCircuit-Level Gateway\n73\nCircuit-level proxy\nSets up two TCP connections, one between itself and a TCP user on an inner host and one on an outside host\nRelays TCP segments from one connection to the other without examining contents\nSecurity function consists of determining which connections will be allowed\n\n\nTypically used when inside users are trusted\nMay use application-level gateway inbound and circuit-level gateway outbound\nLower overheads \n\n\n\n\n\n\n74\nModule 4 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning\nDigital Forensics\nCybersecurity Engineering\nSecurity policies\nFirewalls\nAuthentication, Access controls\nFederated trust\nIoT/Cloud middleware\nAuthentication\n75\nThe process of establishing confidence in user identities that are presented electronically to an information system\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentification and Authentication Security Requirements\n76\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthenticating User Identity - Basis\n77\nMulti-factor Authentication\n78\nMultifactor authentication refers to the use of more than one of the authentication means \nRisk Assessment for User Authentication\n79\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssurance Level\n80\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Impact\n81\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIPS 199 defines three levels of potential impact on organizations or individuals should there be a breach of security:\nLow\nAn authentication error could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals\nModerate\nAn authentication error could be expected to have a serious adverse effect\nHigh \nAn authentication error could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Potential Impacts for Each Assurance Level\n82\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassword Cracking\n83\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiometric Authentication\n84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempts to authenticate an individual based on unique physical characteristics\n\nBased on pattern recognition\n\nIs technically complex and expensive when compared to passwords and tokens\n\nPhysical characteristics used include:\nFacial characteristics\nFingerprints\nHand geometry\nRetinal pattern \nIris \nSignature \nVoice\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiometric Authentication – Cost vs. Accuracy\n85\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiometric Authentication – Process\n86\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication Security Issues\n87\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Attacks, Susceptible Authenticators, and Typical Defenses \n88\n\n\n\n\n\n\nen·tro·py: lack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorder\nPotential Attacks, Susceptible Authenticators, and Typical Defenses \n89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n90\nModule 4 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning\nDigital Forensics\nCybersecurity Engineering\nSecurity policies\nFirewalls\nAuthentication, Access controls\nFederated trust\nIoT/Cloud middleware\nAccess Control\n91\nProcess by which use of system resources is regulated according to a security policy and is permitted only by authorized entities (users, programs, processes, or other systems) according to that policy\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Control Security Requirements\n92\nAccess Control Policies\n93\nDiscretionary access control (DAC)\nControls access based on the identity of the requestor and on access rules (authorizations) stating what requestors are (or are not) allowed to do\n\nMandatory access control (MAC)\nControls access based on comparing security labels with security clearances \nAn entity that has clearance to access a resource may not, just by its own volition, enable another entity to access that resource\nRole-based access control (RBAC)\nControls access based on the roles that users have within the system and on rules stating what accesses are allowed to users in given roles\n\nAttribute-based access control (ABAC)\nControls access based on attributes of the user, the resource to be accessed, and current environmental conditions\n\nThese four policies are not mutually exclusive; an access control mechanism can employ two or even all three of these policies to cover different classes of system resources\nSubjects, Objects, and Access Rights\n94\nDiscretionary Access Control (DAC) \n95\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme in which an entity may be granted access rights that permit the entity, by its own violation, to enable another entity to access some resource\n\nOften provided using an access matrix\nOne dimension consists of identified subjects that may attempt data access to the resources\nThe other dimension lists the objects that may be accessed\n\nEach entry in the matrix indicates the access rights of a particular subject for a particular object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Control Structures Example\n96\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Matrix\nUser A owns files 1 and 3 and has read and write access rights to those\nfiles. User B has read access rights to file 1, and so on.\nAccess Control Lists\n97\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe access matrix may be decomposed by columns, yielding access control lists (ACLs)\nFor each object, an ACL lists users and their permitted access rights. The ACL may contain a default, or public, entry. This allows users that are not explicitly listed as having special rights to have a default set of rights. The default set of rights should always follow the rule of least privilege or read-only access, whichever is applicable. Elements of the list may include individual users as well as groups of users.\nExtended Access Control Matrix\n98\n\n\n\n\n\nTo represent the protection state, we extend the universe of objects in the access control matrix to include the following:\nProcesses:  Access rights include the ability to delete a process, stop (block), and wake up a process\nDevices:  Access rights include the ability to read/write the device, to control its operation (e.g., a disk seek), and to block/unblock the device for use\nMemory locations or regions:  Access rights include the ability to read/write certain regions of memory that are protected such that the default is to disallow access\nSubjects: Access rights with respect to a subject have to do with the ability to grantor delete access rights of that subject to other objects, as explained subsequently\nRole-Based Access Control\n99\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional DAC systems define the access rights of individual users and groups of users\n\nIn contrast, RBAC is based on the roles that users assume in a system rather than the user’s identity\nTypically, RBAC models define a role as a job function within an organization\nRBAC systems assign access rights to roles instead of individual users\nIn turn, users are assigned to different roles, either statically or dynamically, according to their responsibilities\n\nUsers, Roles and Resources\nAccess Control Matrix in RBAC\n100\n\n\n\n\n\nRBAC Models\n101\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Practice: Auth0\nAttribute-Based Access Control\n102\n\n\n\n\n\nABAC Model Attributes\n103\n\n\n\n\n\nABAC Scenario\n104\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear from the logical architecture that there are four independent sources of information used for the access control decision. The system designer can decide which attributes are important for access control with respect to subjects, objects, and environmental conditions. The system designer or other authority can then define access control policies, in the form of rules, for any desired combination of attributes of subject, object, and environmental conditions.\nABAC Distinguishable Characteristics\n105\n\n\n\n\n\nApply ABAC if\nYou’re in a large organization with many users\nYou want deep, specific access control capabilities\nYou have time to invest in a model that goes the distance\nYou need to ensure privacy and security compliance\nEnterprise-wide Access Control \n106\n\n\n\n\n\n107\nModule 4 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning\nDigital Forensics\nCybersecurity Engineering\nSecurity policies\nFirewalls\nAuthentication, Access controls\nFederated trust\nIoT/Cloud middleware\nIdentity Federation\n108\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm used to describe the technology, standards, policies, and processes that allow an organization to trust digital identities, identity attributes, and credentials created and issued by another organization\n\nAddresses two questions:\nHow do you trust identities of individuals from external organizations who need access to your systems\nHow do you vouch for identities of individuals in your organization when they need to collaborate with external organizations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentity Information Exchange Approaches\n109\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth 2.0 Intro.\nOAuth 2 is an authorization framework that enables applications — such as Facebook, GitHub, and DigitalOcean — to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. \nIt works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts a user account and authorizing third-party applications to access that user account. \nOAuth 2 provides authorization flows for web and desktop applications, as well as mobile devices.\nOAuth Roles\nOAuth defines four roles:\nResource Owner: The resource owner is the user who authorizes an application to access their account. The application’s access to the user’s account is limited to the scope of the authorization granted (e.g. read or write access)\nClient: The client is the application that wants to access the user’s account.
