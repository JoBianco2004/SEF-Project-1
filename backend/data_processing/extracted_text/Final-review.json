learning to decide on tradeoffs in energy, latency and security in deciding computing policies at core or edge\n4\nDetails in Module 4…\nManufacturing Application \u000bSecurity & Privacy\n5\n“Agile manufacturing” builds on the benefits of cloud computing (e.g., businesses\nDon’t need to invest and manage expensive computing resources or computational solver licenses) \nNeed to bridge the collaboration gap between Manufacturing App Developer and a Cloud Engineer  in “Manufacturing App Marketplaces”\n\nOr AWS, GCP, …\nManufacturing App Marketplace \u000bSecurity Architecture\n6\nHow to secure on-going efforts to scale-up the App Marketplace with user opt-in via a new web-access layer features?\n(a) an integrated single sign-on authentication\n(b) on-demand/secure access to run virtual desktops, and virtual machines for web servers to host the various Apps\n(c) secure storage of results after the computation stages to protect intellectual property of the manufacturers’ App designs and data sets\n(d) Defense against LoC using HoneyFiles (Defense by Pretense)\n\nSmartGrid Application\n7\nWide-area measurement and control systems (WAMCS) technology using Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) is important\nHelps guarantee resilience, stability, reliability, state estimation, control, and protection of next-generation power systems\nHowever, there is an exponentially increasing number of PMUs and PDCs being deployed in the North American grid\nResult is an explosion in data volume, which needs an efficient wide-area communication and computing infrastructure\nSmartGrid Application\n8\nAs an example for power grids, according to UCAlug Open Smart Grid, every PMU (from a utility company) requires 600 to 1500 Kbps bandwidth, 20 ms to 200 ms latency, almost 100% reliability, and a 24-hour backup\nWAMCS will require cloud computing resources (e.g., storage) and Gigabit per second bandwidth for satisfactory performance and resilience\nChallenges are even more aggravated by the gradual transition from centralized to distributed systems for increased speed of data processing\nWith SDN\nPrivacy and Non-disclosure issues\nSmartGrid Security Architecture\n9\nHow to secure on-going efforts to store and process PMU data with utility companies opt-in via a new web-access layer and software-defined network features?\n(a) an integrated single

learning is critical to reveal “evidence” in cyber attack incidents\nWithout (good) data, there is no knowledge\nTime-series data can be valuable for descriptive and predictive analytics of anomaly events\nUseful for malware research, penetration testing, etc.\nThreat intelligence collection supported by data is critical for decision making in real-life cyber operations/risk management\nHelps cybersecurity engineers prioritize and focus on critical events than working by instinct\n\n\n\nMany large organizations are hiring data scientists to help with cybersecurity analytics\nData-driven Cyber Intelligence Collection\n12\nThreat intelligence sharing helps a cyber analyst’s monitoring objectives for ‘soft critical events’ and ‘silent critical events’ relating to either performance bottlenecks that may relate to security incidents… \nData-driven Cyber Intelligence Collection\n13\nNeed to use statistical data planning policies in systems by considering variations of data structures of the many data silos involved \nActive measurements (ping, traceroute, Iperf or other such one-end or double-end measurement probing)\nPassive measurements (Netflow records, DNS, pcap, host logs, crash dumps, process logs, memory logs) \n\nMonitoring objectives drive network and host device data collection, storage and analysis/visualization in cyber threat hunting\n”Data farming” needs to be synergistic to “Data mining”\n\nMonitoring strategies for expected performance/safety assurances violations due to ‘soft failures’ or ‘silent failures’ \nVersus ‘hard failures’ or ‘failure alarms’ where faults are more apparent to operations personnel using traditional monitoring systems or intrusion detection systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmerging AI Technologies for Cyber Hunting\nAutoML -

defense, Defense by pretense\nAnomaly detection\nThreat intelligence collection\nPenetration testing\nRisk assessment and management\nPenetration Testing / Pen Testing\n21\nMinimum human supervision\nEvaluate security of an IT infrastructure by safely trying (i.e., ethical hacking) to exploit vulnerabilities with written permission\nPerformed at different levels e.g., OS level, web apps level, wired/wireless network services level, end-user level, …\nAssessment to help identify misconfigurations, risky user behavior and validate the efficacy of defense mechanisms\nGoal is to find vulnerabilities before any attacker\nTwo types of Pen Testing\nBlack box: testing external components targeted with public or zero-day exploits (Black Hat)\nWhite box: testing internal components (White Hat) \nCould combine for Grey box testing\n\n\n\nPenetration Testing / Pen Testing\n22\nMinimum human supervision\nManual or automated approaches are used\nPen tester goal is to exploit a particular vulnerability and use compromised hosts to launch new exploits at other internal resources\nDocument the combination of vulnerabilities exploited in a particular sequence \nTesting ends if highest level of privilege escalation or highest levels of security clearance is attained\nA report is produced for decision makers with:\nExposed vulnerabilities in terms of attack surfaces\nStrategic conclusions on impact on business and operations\nPriorities for remediation against threats and attack vectors\nApprovals needed for fixes\nNotifications are sent to relevant stakeholders e.g., senior management, vendors of hardware/software\nPen Tester must close out work (e.g., backdoors to maintain access, etc.) to avoid someone else from exploiting the vulnerabilities later\n\n\n\nPenetration Testing Steps\n23\nMinimum human supervision\nInformation Intelligence\nUsing tools such as nmap, nslookup, people finders/Google search\nPerforming people profiling to target (e.g., via email or phone) as part of social engineering\n\nScanning and Enumerating\nTCP and UDP port scanning to learn about target environment and find exposed vulnerabilities\nUsing tools such as metasploit, nc, nessus for high-speed discovery, configuration auditing, asset profiling, sensitive data discovery\n\nAdvanced Fingerprinting\nAdvanced fingerprinting of web applications, DNS, load balancers, etc. using scanning methods\n\nVulnerability Assessment\nOverlaps with Pen Testing but largely non-intrusive to identify vulnerabilities in systems/networks and analyze security posture\n\t\n\n\n\nVulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)\n24\nMinimum human supervision\nAutomated/cheaper, minutes, scheduled, passive, “breadth over depth”\n\nPopular Tools: Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto, SAINT\nOften manual/expensive, days, opportunistic/intuitive, aggressive, “depth over breadth”\n\nPopular Tools: Metasploit, Kali Linux, NetSparker, Core Impact, Aircrack-ng, John Ripper, backtrack, wireshark\nWhich one to choose and when, VA or PT? How do they differ from a security audit to check compliance with standard security policies and procedures?\nVulnerability Assessment – dealing with Myths\n25\nMinimum human supervision\n“I have a firewall or use anti-virus to fend off attacks”\n+) Firewalls can be effective to mitigate threats and isolate/protect\n-) Hackers understand firewall strategies; can take down or by-pass a firewall through exploiting software bugs or admin oversight\n-) End-to-end session hijacking not detectable by firewalls\n\n“Web security is handled by using HTTPS”\n+) Encryption of communication from source to destination is secure\n-) Not effective against DDoS, brute force attacks, SQL injection\n-) Organizations can be compromised by fake SSL certificates\n\n“Our systems and data are not worthwhile targets”\n+) Small business enterprises may not be attractive targets\n-) More easy to attack since they may not take security seriously\n-) Ransomeware attacks are frequent and impact small businesses\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\nMany other vulnerabilities: weak passwords, OS command injection, buffer overflow, privilege over-provisioning, unrestricted uploads of dangerous file types, outdated software, … \n26\nModule-3: Discussion Topics\nSecurity architectures\nMoving target defense, Defense by pretense\nAnomaly detection\nThreat intelligence collection\nPenetration testing\nRisk assessment and management\nIT Security Management\nHelps in determining a clear view of an organization’s IT security objectives, security/privacy policies and general risk profile\nFormal (iterative) process of answering questions such as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that critical assets are sufficiently protected in a cost-effective manner\nSecurity risk assessment is needed for each asset in the organization that requires protection\nProvides the information necessary to decide what management, operational, and technical controls are needed to reduce the risks identified\n\n27\nIT Security Management [ISO13335] \n28\nIT Security Management is a Cyclic Process\n29\nCyclic process of must be repeated constantly in order to keep pace with the rapid changes in both IT technology and the risk environment\nPlan – Do – Check - Act Process Model\n30\nPlan:  Establish security policy, objectives, processes and procedures; perform risk assessment; develop risk treatment plan with appropriate selection of controls or acceptance of risk\n\nDo:  Implement the risk treatment plan\n\nCheck:  Monitor and maintain the risk treatment plan\n\nAct:  Maintain and improve the information security risk management\nprocess in response to incidents, review, or identified changes\nOrganizational Context and Security Policy\n31\nMaintained and updated regularly\nUsing periodic security reviews\nReflect changing technical/risk environments\n\nExamine role and importance of IT systems in organization\nWhich essential decisions depend on the accuracy, currency, integrity, or availability of data managed by the IT systems?\nWhat data created, managed, processed, and stored by the IT systems need protection?\nWhat are the consequences to the organization of a security failure in their IT systems?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizational Security Policy\n32\nNeeds to be addressed:\nScope and purpose including relation of objectives to business, legal, regulatory requirements\nIT security requirements of assets (in terms of CIA triad)\nAssignment of responsibilities across the organizational structure\nRisk management approach\nSecurity awareness and training\nIntegration of security into systems development\nInformation classification scheme\nContingency and business continuity planning\nIncident detection and handling processes\nHow and when policy reviewed, and change control to it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Risk Assessment\n33\nCritical component of process in IT security management\n\nIdeally examine every organizational asset\nNot feasible in practice\n The time and effort required, even for large, well-resourced organizations, is clearly neither achievable nor cost effective \n\nApproaches to identifying and mitigating risks to an organization’s IT infrastructure:\nBaseline approach\nInformal approach\nDetailed risk analysis\nCombined approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaseline Approach\n34\nGoal is to implement agreed controls to provide protection against the most common threats\n\nForms a good base for further security measures\n\nUse “industry best practice”\nEasy, cheap, can be replicated\nGives no special consideration to variations in risk exposure\nMay give too much or too little security due to rough baseline\n\nGenerally recommended only for small organizations without the resources to implement more structured approaches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformal Approach\n35\nDetailed Risk Analysis (Formal Process)\n36\nCombined Approach\n37\nCombines elements of the baseline, informal, and detailed risk analysis approaches\nAim is to provide reasonable levels of protection as quickly as possible and adjust the protection controls deployed on key systems over time\n\nApproach starts with the implementation of suitable baseline security recommendations on all systems\nNext, systems either exposed to high risk levels or critical to the organization's business objectives are identified in the high-level risk assessment\nA decision can then be made to possibly conduct an immediate informal risk assessment on key systems, with the aim of relatively quickly tailoring controls to more accurately reflect their requirements\nLastly, an ordered process of performing detailed risk analyses of these systems can be instituted\n\nOver time, this can result in the most appropriate and cost-effective security controls being selected and implemented on these systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Risk Analysis\n38\nThreat Identification\n39\nRisk Treatment Alternatives\n40\nE.g., taking out insurance against the risk occurring, by entering into a contract with another organization\nThe loss of this capability is traded off against the reduced risk profile\nE.g., implementing an off-site backup process, developing a disaster recovery plan, or arranging for data and processing to be replicated over multiple sites\nE.g., include technical or administrative controls such as deploying firewalls and access tokens, or change policies\nAnalyze Risks\n41\nSpecify likelihood of occurrence of each identified threat to asset given existing controls\n\nSpecify consequence should threat occur\n\nDerive overall risk rating for each threat\nRisk = probability threat occurs x cost to organization\n\nHard to determine accurate probabilities and realistic cost          consequences\n\nUse qualitative and quantitative ratings, heat maps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Level

available to scan networks for vulnerabilities\nSecurity procedures can provide a network environment with more secure computing\n46\nBasics of Assessing a System\nKnowing how to begin securing a system can be daunting\nThe stages of assessing a system’s security can be categorized into the six Ps:\nPatch – check and keep system patches up to date\nPorts – shut down any unneeded ports\nProtect – implement a firewall and IDS\nPolicies – enforce written policies on computer security\nProbe – regularly probe network for security flaws\nPhysical – use policies for securing server rooms, individual workstations, and other physical equipment\n47\nDMZ (Demilitarized Zone)\n48\nScanning Your Network\nTo keep a network secure, routinely check the network for vulnerabilities and flaws\nCommon vulnerability scanners include:\nNESSUS – the premiere network vulnerability scanner\nOWASP Zap – the standard for web application vulnerability\nShodan – used by black hat hackers and security professionals\nKali Linux – Linux distribution with open-source tools for cybersecurity, digital forensics, and penetration testing\nVega – free, open-source scanner for web applications\nOpenVAS – open-source vulnerability scanner that includes several services and tools\n49\nTesting and Scanning Standards\nThere are specific standards that relate to vulnerability scans and penetration tests\nCommon testing and scanning standards include:\nNIST 800-115 – general guide for testing and assessment\nNSA-IAM – excellent guide for penetration tests\nPCI DSS – standard used by major credit card companies\nNational Vulnerability Database\nU.S. government repository of vulnerability data\nUses the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)\n50\nSummary\nPeriodically assess a network or system for security vulnerabilities\nWeekly for high-security sites\nQuarterly for noncritical or low-security sites\nSafe computing involves securing all computers, networks, and servers, and using common sense on the Web\nApply security practices and standards to all aspects of network systems\n51\nModule 4 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning\nDigital Forensics\nCybersecurity Engineering\nSecurity policies\nFirewalls\nAuthentication, Access controls\nFederated trust\nIoT/Cloud middleware\n52\nObjectives\nUnderstand basic systems engineering concepts\nUnderstand how to integrate systems engineering into cybersecurity\nUtilize engineering tools in cybersecurity\nExplain the use of standards in cybersecurity engineering\n53\nIntroduction\nThe field of cybersecurity is growing rapidly\nPresents challenges for defining the profession\nMany different approaches are used in cybersecurity and cybersecurity education\nPracticed as a business management discipline\nApproached as a computer science sub-discipline\nWide range of technical backgrounds and skill sets for practitioners\nCybersecurity can be viewed as an engineering discipline—a sub-discipline of systems engineering\n54\nDefining Cybersecurity Engineering\nCybersecurity and Systems Engineering\nCybersecurity involves diverse computer systems, human processes, operating systems, and more\nCybersecurity could be considered a sub-discipline of systems engineering\nSystems engineering is concerned with a given system, or system of systems, throughout the system life cycle\nBegins with the concept phase and continues through system disposal\nThis is an appropriate approach for cybersecurity engineering\n55\nDefining Cybersecurity Engineering\nApplying Engineering to Cybersecurity\nA cybersecurity project should begin by defining the requirements\nUse the SMART acronym for effective requirements:\nSpecific\nMeasurable\nAchievable\nRealistic\nTimely\nA tool to aid in planning is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), which breaks a project into smaller tasks; see the next slide for an example\n\n56\nWork Breakdown Structure\n57\nStandards\nEvery engineering discipline has specific standards\nStandards in the cybersecurity industry include:\nRMF: Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework\nISO 27001: Standard for Information Security Management System (ISMS)\nISO 27004: How to Measure Information Security\nNIST SP 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines\n58\nModeling\nCybersecurity engineering is directed toward some threat\nModeling ensures you are building your security to counter the threats specific to your systems\nDifferent modeling concepts include:\nSTRIDE: Identifies threats in six categories\nPASTA: Risk-centric seven-step methodology\nDREAD: Mnemonic for risk rating using five categories\n\n59\nSummary\nThere are various applications of systems engineering to cybersecurity\nThe goal is to apply a methodical, systematic approach to cybersecurity\nPenetration testing should be a carefully engineered process mapped to specific testing requirements\nIt is beneficial to model cybersecurity scenarios to better understand system security requirements\n60\nModule 4 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning\nDigital Forensics\nCybersecurity Engineering\nSecurity policies\nFirewalls\nAuthentication, Access controls\nFederated trust\nIoT/Cloud middleware\nIT Security Management Controls\n61\nSecurity Control\n62\nControl is defined as:\n\n“An action, device, procedure, or other measure that reduces risk by eliminating or preventing a security violation, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it to enable corrective action.”\n\n\nControl Classifications\n63\nManagement controls\nFocus on security policies, planning, guidelines, and standards that influence the selection of operational and technical controls to reduce the risk of loss and to protect the organization’s mission\nThese controls refer to issues that management needs to address\nOperational controls\nAddress the correct implementation and use of security policies and standards, ensuring consistency in security operations and correcting identified operational deficiencies\nThese controls relate to mechanisms and procedures that are primarily implemented by people rather than systems\nThey are used to improve the security of a system or group of systems\nTechnical controls\nInvolve the security policies on correct use of hardware and software security capabilities in systems\nThese range from simple to complex measures that work together to secure critical and sensitive data, information, and IT systems functions\n\nTechnical Security Controls\n64\nIT Security Plan\n65\nProvides details of:\nWhat will be done\nWhat resources are needed\nWho is responsible\nGoal is to detail the actions needed to improve the identified deficiencies in the risk profile\n\n\nSecurity Plan Implementation\n66\nSecurity Plan Implementation (2)\n67\nSecurity Plan Implementation Follow-up\n68\nSecurity management is a cyclic process\nConstantly repeated to respond to changes in the IT systems and the risk environment\nNeed to monitor implemented controls\nEvaluate changes for security implications\t\nOtherwise increase chance of security breach\nSecurity Plan Maintenance\n69\nNeed continued maintenance and monitoring of implemented controls to ensure continued correct functioning and appropriateness\nGoal is to ensure controls perform as intended\n\n\n70\nModule 4 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning\nDigital Forensics\nCybersecurity Engineering\nSecurity policies\nFirewalls\nAuthentication, Access controls\nFederated trust\nIoT/Cloud middleware\nThe Need For Firewalls\n71\nInternet connectivity is essential\nHowever it creates a threat\n\nEffective means of protecting LANs\n\nInserted between the premises network and the Internet to establish a controlled link\nCan be a single computer system or a set of two or more systems working together\n\nUsed as a perimeter defense\nSingle choke point to impose security and auditing \nInsulates the internal systems from external networks\n\nFirewall Characteristics\n72\nDesign Goals:\nAll traffic from inside to outside, and vice versa, must pass through the firewall\n\nOnly authorized traffic as defined by the local security policy will be allowed to pass\n\nThe firewall itself is immune to penetration\nNot always true\n\nThe firewall of a large-sized enterprise network can typically have a ruleset or ACL (Access Control List) comprising 10K+ rules\nLast-matching rules are located at the bottom of the ruleset and consume the most CPU processing power of firewalls\nIf these rules get discovered by an attacker, the attacker can effectively launch a low-rate DoS attack that can bring the firewall to its knees\nCountermeasures: Random delay, periodic re-arranging of rules or caching\n\n\n\nK. Salah, K. Sattar, A. Baig, M. Squalli, P. Calyam, “Resiliency of Popular Network Firewalls against Remote Discovery of Last-Matching Rules”, ACM Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN), 2009.\nFirewall Access Policy\n73\nA critical component in the planning and implementation of a firewall is specifying a suitable access policy\nThis lists the types of traffic authorized to pass through the firewall\nIncludes address ranges, protocols, applications and content types\n\nThis policy should be developed from the organization’s information security risk assessment and policy\n\nShould be developed from a broad specification of which traffic types the organization needs to support\nThen refined to detail the filter elements which can then be implemented within an appropriate firewall topology\n\n\n\nFirewall Filter Characteristics\n74\nCharacteristics that a firewall access policy could use to filter traffic include (as per NIST SP 800-41):\n\n\nFirewall Capabilities and Limits\n75\nCapabilities:\n\tDefines a single choke point\n\tProvides a location for monitoring security events\n\tConvenient platform for several Internet functions that are not security related\n\tCan serve as the platform for IPSec\nIPSec is a standard suite of protocols between 2 communication points across the IP network that provide data authentication, integrity, and confidentiality; It also defines the encrypted, decrypted and authenticated packets\n\nLimitations:\n\tCannot protect against attacks bypassing firewall\n\tMay not protect fully against internal threats\n\tImproperly secured wireless LAN can be accessed from outside the organization\n\tLaptop, or portable storage device may be infected outside the corporate network then used internally\n\n\n\nTypes of Firewalls\n76\nTypes of Firewalls (2)\n77\nPacket Filtering Firewall\n78\nApplies rules to each incoming and outgoing IP packet \nTypically a list of rules based on matches in the IP or TCP header\nForwards or discards the packet based on rules match\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo default policies:\nDiscard - prohibit unless expressly permitted\nMore conservative, controlled, visible to users\nForward - permit unless expressly prohibited\nEasier to manage and use but less secure\n\n\n\n\nPacket Filtering Examples\n79\nDo you see problems with this rule set?\nRule 4 allows external traffic to any destination port above 1023. As an example of an exploit of this rule, an\nexternal attacker can open a connection from the attacker’s port 5150 to an internal Web proxy server on port 8080. This is supposed to be forbidden and could allow an attack on the server.\n\nTo counter this attack, the firewall rule set can be configured with a source port field for each row. For rules 2 and 4, the source port is set to 25; for rules 1 and 3, the source port is set to >1023.\n\nPacket Filtering Advantages and Weaknesses\n80\nAdvantages:\nSimplicity\nTypically transparent to users and are very fast\n\nWeaknesses:\nCannot prevent attacks that employ application specific vulnerabilities or functions\nLimited logging functionality\nDo not support advanced user authentication\nVulnerable to attacks on TCP/IP protocol bugs\nImproper configuration can lead to breaches\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Firewalls\n81\nStateful Inspection Firewall\n82\nExample Stateful Firewall Connection State\n83\n84\nModule 4 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning\nDigital Forensics\nCybersecurity Engineering\nSecurity policies\nFirewalls\nAuthentication, Access controls\nFederated trust\nIoT/Cloud middleware\nAuthentication\n85\nThe process of establishing confidence in user identities that are presented electronically to an information system\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentification and Authentication Security Requirements\n86\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthenticating User Identity - Basis\n87\nMulti-factor Authentication\n88\nMultifactor authentication refers to the use of more than one of the authentication means \nRisk Assessment for User Authentication\n89\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssurance Level\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassword Cracking\n91\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiometric Authentication\n92\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempts to authenticate an individual based on unique physical characteristics\n\nBased on pattern recognition\n\nIs technically complex and expensive when compared to passwords and tokens\n\nPhysical characteristics used include:\nFacial characteristics\nFingerprints\nHand geometry\nRetinal pattern \nIris \nSignature \nVoice\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential Attacks, Susceptible Authenticators, and Typical Defenses \n93\n\n\n\n\n\n\nen·tro·py: lack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorder\nPotential Attacks, Susceptible Authenticators, and Typical Defenses \n94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n95\nModule 4 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning\nDigital Forensics\nCybersecurity Engineering\nSecurity policies\nFirewalls\nAuthentication, Access controls\nFederated trust\nIoT/Cloud middleware\nAccess Control\n96\nProcess by which use of system resources is regulated according to a security policy and is permitted only by authorized entities (users, programs, processes, or other systems) according to that policy\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Control Security Requirements\n97\nAccess Control Policies\n98\nDiscretionary access control (DAC)\nControls access based on the identity of the requestor and on access rules (authorizations) stating what requestors are (or are not) allowed to do\n\nMandatory access control (MAC)\nControls access based on comparing security labels with security clearances \nAn entity that has clearance to access a resource may not, just by its own volition, enable another entity to access that resource\nRole-based access control (RBAC)\nControls access based on the roles that users have within the system and on rules stating what accesses are allowed to users in given roles\n\nAttribute-based access control (ABAC)\nControls access based on attributes of the user, the resource to be accessed, and current environmental conditions\n\nThese four policies are not mutually exclusive; an access control mechanism can employ two or even all three of these policies to cover different classes of system resources\nSubjects, Objects, and Access Rights\n99\nDiscretionary Access Control (DAC) \n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme in which an entity may be granted access rights that permit the entity, by its own violation, to enable another entity to access some resource\n\nOften provided using an access matrix\nOne dimension consists of identified subjects that may attempt data access to the resources\nThe other dimension lists the objects that may be accessed\n\nEach entry in the matrix indicates the access rights of a particular subject for a particular object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Control Structures Example\n101\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Matrix\nUser A owns files 1 and 3 and has read and write access rights to those\nfiles. User B has read access rights to file 1, and so on.\nAccess Control Lists\n102\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe access matrix may be decomposed by columns, yielding access control lists (ACLs)\nFor each object, an ACL lists users and their permitted access rights. The ACL may contain a default, or public, entry. This allows users that are not explicitly listed as having special rights to have a default set of rights. The default set of rights should always follow the rule of least privilege or read-only access, whichever is applicable. Elements of the list may include individual users as well as groups of users.\nExtended Access Control Matrix\n103\n\n\n\n\n\nTo represent the protection state, we extend the universe of objects in the access control matrix to include the following:\nProcesses:  Access rights include the ability to delete a process, stop (block), and wake up a process\nDevices:  Access rights include the ability to read/write the device, to control its operation (e.g., a disk seek), and to block/unblock the device for use\nMemory locations or regions:  Access rights include the ability to read/write certain regions of memory that are protected such that the default is to disallow access\nSubjects: Access rights with respect to a subject have to do with the ability to grantor delete access rights of that subject to other objects, as explained subsequently\nRole-Based Access Control\n104\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional DAC systems define the access rights of individual users and groups of users\n\nIn contrast, RBAC is based on the roles that users assume in a system rather than the user’s identity\nTypically, RBAC models define a role as a job function within an organization\nRBAC systems assign access rights to roles instead of individual users\nIn turn, users are assigned to different roles, either statically or dynamically, according to their responsibilities\n\nUsers, Roles and Resources\nAccess Control Matrix in RBAC\n105\n\n\n\n\n\nRBAC Models\n106\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Practice: Auth0\nAttribute-Based Access Control\n107\n\n\n\n\n\nABAC Model Attributes\n108\n\n\n\n\n\nABAC Scenario\n109\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear from the logical architecture that there are four independent sources of information used for the access control decision. The system designer can decide which attributes are important for access control with respect to subjects, objects, and environmental conditions. The system designer or other authority can then define access control policies, in the form of rules, for any desired combination of attributes of subject, object, and environmental conditions.\nABAC Distinguishable Characteristics\n110\n\n\n\n\n\nApply ABAC if\nYou’re in a large organization with many users\nYou want deep, specific access control capabilities\nYou have time to invest in a model that goes the distance\nYou need to ensure privacy and security compliance\nEnterprise-wide Access Control \n111\n\n\n\n\n\n112\nModule 4 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning\nDigital Forensics\nCybersecurity Engineering\nSecurity policies\nFirewalls\nAuthentication, Access controls\nFederated trust\nIoT/Cloud middleware\nOAuth 2.0 Intro.\nOAuth 2 is an authorization framework that enables applications — such as Facebook, GitHub, and DigitalOcean — to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. \nIt works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts a user account and authorizing third-party applications to access that user account. \nOAuth 2 provides authorization flows for web and desktop applications, as well as mobile devices.\nOAuth Roles\nOAuth defines four roles:\nResource Owner: The resource owner is the user who authorizes an application to access their account. The application’s access to the user’s account is limited to the scope of the authorization granted (e.g. read or write access)\nClient: The client is the application that wants to access the user’s account. Before it may do so, it must be authorized by the user, and the authorization must be validated by the API.\nResource Server: The resource server hosts the protected user accounts.\nAuthorization Server: The authorization server verifies the identity of the user then issues access tokens to the application.\n\nOAuth Steps\nOAuth service steps\nApplication Registration\nApplication Name\nApplication Website\nRedirect URI or Callback URL\nAuthorization Grant – Various Types\nAuthorization Code: used with server-side Applications\nClient Credentials: used with Applications that have API access\nDevice Code: used for devices that lack browsers or have input limitations\n\nMost used Grant Type: Authorization Code\n118\nModule 4 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning\nDigital Forensics\nCybersecurity Engineering\nSecurity policies\nFirewalls\nAuthentication, Access controls\nFederated trust\nIoT/Cloud middleware\nLightweight and Flexible Security for IoT-based Smart City Applications\nRecreated disaster scenes of tornado damages (in Joplin, MO 2011) at the: (a) Joplin High School; (b) Joplin Hospital\n119\nLightweight and Flexible Security for IoT-based Smart City Applications\n\nIoT Gateway Middleware that uses machine learning to decide on tradeoffs in energy, latency and security in deciding computing policies at core or edge\nB.

So the idea of managing actually servers and provisioning storage and dealing with network connectivity is no longer an issue.\nAnother aspect of cloud computing is flexibility, since computing resources are organized into “pools” this allows customers to buy what they need. However they want to buy it.\nThese so-called pools can be instantly provisioned and rolled-out (or deprovisioned and taken offline) meaning there aren’t constraints to how quickly the infrastructure can be changed.\nCloud resources can be scaled up and/or down with ease, providing a customer the ability to scale their environment based on usage, not based on hardware.\n\n\n\n\nPotential benefits\nOf Cloud Computing \n\nNo Capital Expenditures\nMore Agility\nUnbounded Scale\nImproved Resource Utilization\nCustomer-controlled Migration\nResilience\nPay for Use \nAgility Resiliency Economics\n127\nNIST Cloud Computing Model\n128\nCloud Service\n\n     \nThe SPI stack. \nS for Software as a Service. \nP for Platform as a Service. \nI for Infrastructure as a Service. \nInfrastructure as a Service(IaaS)\nThe customer then can install its own software or interact with the computing infrastructure via a set of abstractions and/or APIs.\n\nThe consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).\n130\nSimplified IaaS Architecture\n\n131\nPlatform as a Service(PaaS)\n\nApplication development frameworks, middleware capabilities, as well as functionalities like databases, messaging, queues, etc.\nDeploying services created or acquired by users to cloud infrastructure\nCreating applications using programming languages and tools supported by cloud providers\n132\nSimplified PaaS Architecture\n\n133\nSoftware as a Service(SaaS)\nUsers utilize applications provided by service providers.\nSaaS doesn't necessarily have to run on IaaS or PaaS, but still needs to have basic cloud characteristics.\nUsers cannot manage or control the underlying infrastructure including networks, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities.\n\n134\nSimplified SaaS Architecture\n136\nModule 5 – Cloud and IoT Security\n\nIntroduction to Cloud Computing\nSecurity on Cloud Services\nCloud Storage Security\nCloud Application Security and Access Control\nIntroduction to Internet of Things\nIoT Security and Cloud\n\nmacro layers \n\n137\n138\n139\n\nmacro layers \nSecurity Suggestions \n\nSuggestions on Virtual Infrastructure\n\n\nIt's preferable to use SDN if available.\nUtilize SDN functionality for multiple virtual networks and multiple cloud accounts/segments to enhance network isolation.\nIndependent accounts and virtual networks greatly limit the scope of harm compared to traditional data centers.\nImplement default deny on cloud firewalls.\nBase cloud firewall policies on each workload rather than per network application.\nUse cloud firewall policies to restrict communication between workloads within the same virtual subnet as much as possible, such as using security groups.\n141\nSuggestions on Fundamental Resources\n\n\nStore logs externally from the workload.\n\nUnderstand and comply with the cloud provider's limitations on vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.\nDisable remote access.\nIntegrate security testing into the image creation process.\nSet up alerts and file integrity monitoring.\nPatch by updating images rather than directly patching running instances.\nSelect security agents that are cloud-aware and minimize performance impact.\nMaintain security controls for long-running workloads using tools that can identify the cloud environment.\n142\n\n\nSuggestions on Management Plane\n\nEnsure that API gateways and web consoles have sufficient perimeter security.\n\nUtilize strong authentication and multi-factor authentication.\n\nStrictly control the credentials of the main account holder/root account and consider dual authorization access to them.\n\nEstablishing multiple accounts with your provider will help with account granularity and limit the scope of harm (using IaaS and PaaS).\n143\n144\nModule 5 – Cloud and IoT Security\n\nIntroduction to Cloud Computing\nSecurity on Cloud Services\nCloud Storage Security\nCloud Application Security and Access Control\nIntroduction to Internet of Things\nIoT Security and Cloud\nUnderstand the unique capabilities of the cloud platform you are using.\n\nDon't overlook data security from the cloud provider.
