detection\nThreat intelligence collection\nPenetration testing\nRisk assessment and management\nIT Security Management\nHelps in determining a clear view of an organization’s IT security objectives, security/privacy policies and general risk profile\nFormal (iterative) process of answering questions such as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that critical assets are sufficiently protected in a cost-effective manner\nSecurity risk assessment is needed for each asset in the organization that requires protection\nProvides the information necessary to decide what management, operational, and technical controls are needed to reduce the risks identified\n\n4\nIT Security Management [ISO13335] \n5\nIT Security Management is a Cyclic Process\n6\nCyclic process of must be repeated constantly in order to keep pace with the rapid changes in both IT technology and the risk environment\nPlan – Do – Check - Act Process Model\n7\nPlan:  Establish security policy, objectives, processes and procedures; perform risk assessment; develop risk treatment plan with appropriate selection of controls or acceptance of risk\n\nDo:  Implement the risk treatment plan\n\nCheck:  Monitor and maintain the risk treatment plan\n\nAct:  Maintain and improve the information security risk management\nprocess in response to incidents, review, or identified changes\nOrganizational Context and Security Policy\n8\nMaintained and updated regularly\nUsing periodic security reviews\nReflect changing technical/risk environments\n\nExamine role and importance of IT systems in organization\nWhich essential decisions depend on the accuracy, currency, integrity, or availability of data managed by the IT systems?\nWhat data created, managed, processed, and stored by the IT systems need protection?\nWhat are the consequences to the organization of a security failure in their IT systems?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizational Security Policy\n9\nNeeds to be addressed:\nScope and purpose including relation of objectives to business, legal, regulatory requirements\nIT security requirements of assets (in terms of CIA triad)\nAssignment of responsibilities across the organizational structure\nRisk management approach\nSecurity awareness and training\nIntegration of security into systems development\nInformation classification scheme\nContingency and business continuity planning\nIncident detection and handling processes\nHow and when policy reviewed, and change control to it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Risk Assessment\n10\nCritical component of process in IT security management\n\nIdeally examine every organizational asset\nNot feasible in practice\n The time and effort required, even for large, well-resourced organizations, is clearly neither achievable nor cost effective \n\nApproaches to identifying and mitigating risks to an organization’s IT infrastructure:\nBaseline approach\nInformal approach\nDetailed risk analysis\nCombined approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaseline Approach\n11\nGoal is to implement agreed controls to provide protection against the most common threats\n\nForms a good base for further security measures\n\nUse “industry best practice”\nEasy, cheap, can be replicated\nGives no special consideration to variations in risk exposure\nMay give too much or too little security due to rough baseline\n\nGenerally recommended only for small organizations without the resources to implement more structured approaches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformal Approach\n12\nDetailed Risk Analysis (Formal Process)\n13\nCombined Approach\n14\nCombines elements of the baseline, informal, and detailed risk analysis approaches\nAim is to provide reasonable levels of protection as quickly as possible and adjust the protection controls deployed on key systems over time\n\nApproach starts with the implementation of suitable baseline security recommendations on all systems\nNext, systems either exposed to high risk levels or critical to the organization's business objectives are identified in the high-level risk assessment\nA decision can then be made to possibly conduct an immediate informal risk assessment on key systems, with the aim of relatively quickly tailoring controls to more accurately reflect their requirements\nLastly, an ordered process of performing detailed risk analyses of these systems can be instituted\n\nOver time, this can result in the most appropriate and cost-effective security controls being selected and implemented on these systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed Risk Analysis\n15\nThreat Identification\n16\nRisk Treatment Alternatives\n17\nE.g., taking out insurance against the risk occurring, by entering into a contract with another organization\nThe loss of this capability is traded off against the reduced risk profile\nE.g., implementing an off-site backup process, developing a disaster recovery plan, or arranging for data and processing to be replicated over multiple sites\nE.g., include technical or administrative controls such as deploying firewalls and access tokens, or change policies\nAnalyze Risks\n18\nSpecify likelihood of occurrence of each identified threat to asset given existing controls\n\nSpecify consequence should threat occur\n\nDerive overall risk rating for each threat\nRisk = probability threat occurs x cost to organization\n\nHard to determine accurate probabilities and realistic cost          consequences\n\nUse qualitative and quantitative ratings, heat maps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Likelihood\n19\nThere will very likely be some uncertainty and debate over exactly which rating is most appropriate\nThis reflects the qualitative nature of the ratings, ambiguity in their precise meaning, and uncertainty over precisely how likely it is that some threat may eventuate\nIt is important to remember that the goal of this process is to provide guidance to management as to which risks exist, and provide enough information to help management decide how to most appropriately respond\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Consequences\n20\nRisk Level Determination\n21\n***https://www.ready.gov/business/planning/risk-assessment\n"
