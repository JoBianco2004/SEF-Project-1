detection\nThreat intelligence collection\nPenetration testing\nRisk assessment and management\nData Science/ML and Cybersecurity\n4\nData science/machine learning is critical to reveal “evidence” in cyber attack incidents\nWithout (good) data, there is no knowledge\nTime-series data can be valuable for descriptive and predictive analytics of anomaly events\nUseful for malware research, penetration testing, etc.\nThreat intelligence collection supported by data is critical for decision making in real-life cyber operations/risk management\nHelps cybersecurity engineers prioritize and focus on critical events than working by instinct\n\n\n\nMany large organizations are hiring data scientists to help with cybersecurity analytics\nData-driven Cyber Intelligence Collection\n5\nThreat intelligence sharing helps a cyber analyst’s monitoring objectives for ‘soft critical events’ and ‘silent critical events’ relating to either performance bottlenecks that may relate to security incidents… \nData-driven Cyber Intelligence Collection\n6\nNeed to use statistical data planning policies in systems by considering variations of data structures of the many data silos involved \nActive measurements (ping, traceroute, Iperf or other such one-end or double-end measurement probing)\nPassive measurements (Netflow records, DNS, pcap, host logs, crash dumps, process logs, memory logs) \n\nMonitoring objectives drive network and host device data collection, storage and analysis/visualization in cyber threat hunting\n”Data farming” needs to be synergistic to “Data mining”\n\nMonitoring strategies for expected performance/safety assurances violations due to ‘soft failures’ or ‘silent failures’ \nVersus ‘hard failures’ or ‘failure alarms’ where faults are more apparent to operations personnel using traditional monitoring systems or intrusion detection systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-stage Ensemble Learning\n7\nAttack feature analysis is done using a two-stage ensemble learning scheme:\n\nStage A: Outlier Detection\n\nStage B: Outlier Classification\n\n\n\n\nEpsilon is probability that an event is an outlier \u000b– it is tuned in the training phase\n\nIf probability is higher than epsilon or if it is manually triggered, the scheme enters Stage B\nOutlier Detection\n8\nComposition of many efficient, multivariate outlier detectors or hypotheses functions \n\nDetect network-wide correlated anomaly events\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions:\nEnsemble of hypotheses\nFinal ensemble result\nAttack probability function\nThe posterior probability is proportional to the likelihood of the training data D times the prior probability of h\nOutlier Classification\n9\nDetected attacks are classified into either:\nInteresting events (e.g., attacks)\nErroneous conditions (e.g., router failure)\n\nIf final ensemble results of consecutive events fall in same range, we classify as an attack, else the events are ignored\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Ground truth (in addition to high quality data) is extremely important in order to evaluate the accuracy of detected attacks\nThreat Detection and Characterization\n10\nEfficiently detect and characterize cyber threats in a manner that adapts to available data and resource limitations - “sensors for right data at right time”\n\nDetect malicious actions that threaten the integrity of enterprise networks through techniques that integrate information from both networks and hosts  \nGlobal Analysis of Threats\n11\nConstruct global situational awareness to detect otherwise invisible threats \nFocus on malicious activity that is invisible from the perspective of a single network, but becomes apparent when multiple systems share the right data\nAddress what computations need to occur locally, what information must move between locations, and what computations must occur at a central repository \nEmerging AI Technologies for Cyber Hunting\nAutoML - capability of automating the process of building, deploying, and managing machine learning models\nAmazon SageMaker, Big Squid (self-service ML workbench), RapidMiner (visual ML workflow designer)\nAugmented Intelligence - human-centered partnership model of people and AI working together \nEnhance cognitive performance, including learning, decision making, and new experiences \nExplainable AI - an ensemble of methods that make black-box AI algorithms’ outputs sufficiently understandable\nEdge AI - use of AI techniques embedded in IoT endpoints, gateways, and edge devices to act on sensor data\nApplications in streaming analytics for “right data at right time”\n\n12\nhttps://cra.org/ccc/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/Community-Roadmap-for-AI-Research.pdf\nAmazon SageMaker\nAmazon SageMaker - fully managed service to label, build, train, and deploy ML models quickly\nAmazon SageMaker Notebooks, Active learning for ground truth\n\n13\nExplainable AI (XAI)\nML models in new age of applications are opaque, non-intuitive \nXAI improves understanding, trust for people\n\n14\nExplainable AI (XAI) Case Study\nAnomaly detection  network-wide bottleneck event diagnosis or cyber attack detection/mitigation\n\n15\n\nTypical ML Steps\n16\nData used to test a system should be representative of the data the system will see\nML for Cybersecurity Videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6qyO5J_rObFJewJWs89XRA/videos \nCommon Anomaly Detection Analysis Schemes\nStatistical Techniques\nIdentify anomalies without assuming a stochastic model in the measurements\nClassification Techniques\nIdentify the root-cause of anomalies through behavior observation (uses offline training/labeling; online testing on unlabeled measurements for category assignment)\nClustering Techniques\nCategory is not known apriori but placing data points that are similar close to each other – create category based on some distance function\nExpert System Techniques\nRoot-cause analysis by imitiating knowledge of human expert; rule-based or model-based\nGraph-theoretic Techniques\nCausality (cause-effect) or dependency graph representations; algorithms help test various hypotheses or data perspectives\n\n\n\n17\nAI System: “Smart” Workflow to Knowledge-driven Decision Making\nSensing (Assess/Data)\nRecognize important patterns/events in space and time\nFilter out the noise\nTrust in the data\nReasoning (Infer/Learn)\nTurning patterns/events and their relationship into knowledge\nLogic-based inference / evidence-based inference\nLocal/global situation assessment / similarity checking\nBuilding/using knowledge base/catalog with successful example cases\nActing (Predict/Fix)\nEstablish communication goal and generate dialog for a specific crisis\nPlanning / Problem Solving using model predictions\nRobotic Control using software-defined technologies\n\n\n\n18\n19\nModule-4: Discussion Topics\nSecurity architectures\nMoving target defense, Defense by pretense\nAnomaly detection\nThreat intelligence collection\nPenetration testing\nRisk assessment and management\nHacking Humor\u000bHackers find a way!\n20\nMinimum human supervision\nEthical Hacking (Recall)\n21\nMinimum human supervision\n\nEthical hackers learn and perform hacking in a professional manner, based on the direction of the client, and later, present a maturity scorecard highlighting their overall risk and vulnerabilities and suggestions to improve\n\nNew worms, malware, viruses, and ransomware are multiplying every day and creating a need for ethical hacking services to safeguard the networks of businesses, government agencies or defense\n\nAn Ethical Hacker answers the following questions:\nWhat kind of vulnerabilities does an attacker see?\nWhat information or system would a hacker most want access?\nWhat can an attacker do with the information?\nHow many people notice the attempted hack?\nWhat is the best way to fix the vulnerability?\n\nhttps://www.eccouncil.org/ethical-hacking/\nTypes of Ethical Hackers\n22\nMinimum human supervision\nWhite Hat Hacker\nDo not intend to harm the system or organization but they so, officially to penetrate and locate the vulnerabilities, providing to fix them and ensure safety\nBlack Hat Hacker\nThey are non-ethical hackers performing hacking to fulfill their selfish intentions to collect monetary benefits\nGrey Hat Hacker\nCombination of white and black – they hack without any malicious intent for fun; don’t use approval from a targeted organization and publicly disclose any vulnerability\n\n\nPenetration Testing / Pen Testing\n23\nMinimum human supervision\nEvaluate security of an IT infrastructure by safely trying (i.e., ethical hacking) to exploit vulnerabilities with written permission\nPerformed at different levels e.g., OS level, web apps level, wired/wireless network services level, end-user level, …\nAssessment to help identify misconfigurations, risky user behavior and validate the efficacy of defense mechanisms\nGoal is to find vulnerabilities before any attacker\nTwo types of Pen Testing\nBlack box: testing external components targeted with public or zero-day exploits (Black Hat)\nWhite box: testing internal components (White Hat) \nCould combine for Grey box testing\n\n\n\nPenetration Testing / Pen Testing\n24\nMinimum human supervision\nManual or automated approaches are used\nPen tester goal is to exploit a particular vulnerability and use compromised hosts to launch new exploits at other internal resources\nDocument the combination of vulnerabilities exploited in a particular sequence \nTesting ends if highest level of privilege escalation or highest levels of security clearance is attained\nA report is produced for decision makers with:\nExposed vulnerabilities in terms of attack surfaces\nStrategic conclusions on impact on business and operations\nPriorities for remediation against threats and attack vectors\nApprovals needed for fixes\nNotifications are sent to relevant stakeholders e.g., senior management, vendors of hardware/software\nPen Tester must close out work (e.g., backdoors to maintain access, etc.) to avoid someone else from exploiting the vulnerabilities later\n\n\n\nPenetration Testing Steps\n25\nMinimum human supervision\nInformation Intelligence\nUsing tools such as nmap, nslookup, people finders/Google search\nPerforming people profiling to target (e.g., via email or phone) as part of social engineering\n\nScanning and Enumerating\nTCP and UDP port scanning to learn about target environment and find exposed vulnerabilities\nUsing tools such as metasploit, nc, nessus for high-speed discovery, configuration auditing, asset profiling, sensitive data discovery\n\nAdvanced Fingerprinting\nAdvanced fingerprinting of web applications, DNS, load balancers, etc. using scanning methods\n\nVulnerability Assessment\nOverlaps with Pen Testing but largely non-intrusive to identify vulnerabilities in systems/networks and analyze security posture\n\t\n\n\n\nVulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)\n26\nMinimum human supervision\nAutomated/cheaper, minutes, scheduled, passive, “breadth over depth”\n\nPopular Tools: Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto, SAINT\nOften manual/expensive, days, opportunistic/intuitive, aggressive, “depth over breadth”\n\nPopular Tools: Metasploit, Kali Linux, NetSparker, Core Impact, Aircrack-ng, John Ripper, backtrack, wireshark\nWhich one to choose and when, VA or PT? How do they differ from a security audit to check compliance with standard security policies and procedures?\nVulnerability Assessment – dealing with Myths\n27\nMinimum human supervision\n“I have a firewall or use anti-virus to fend off attacks”\n+) Firewalls can be effective to mitigate threats and isolate/protect\n-) Hackers understand firewall strategies; can take down or by-pass a firewall through exploiting software bugs or admin oversight\n-) End-to-end session hijacking not detectable by firewalls\n\n“Web security is handled by using HTTPS”\n+) Encryption of communication from source to destination is secure\n-) Not effective against DDoS, brute force attacks, SQL injection\n-) Organizations can be compromised by fake SSL certificates\n\n“Our systems and data are not worthwhile targets”\n+) Small business enterprises may not be attractive targets\n-) More easy to attack since they may not take security seriously\n-) Ransomeware attacks are frequent and impact small businesses\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\nMany other vulnerabilities: weak passwords, OS command injection, buffer overflow, privilege over-provisioning, unrestricted uploads of dangerous file types, outdated software, … \n"
