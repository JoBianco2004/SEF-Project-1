Think about security before development!\n16\nTopics – design your app with all below\nPhishing assessment on social engineering\nWebsite, Apps (TikTok,News), and SMS\nPhone scams assessments\nFake phone calls, ransom calls, voice changer\nVideo calls assessments\nDeepfake videos, Facetime videos, network problem videos\nAdvertisements\nWebsite ads mistakenly touch, redirect, XSS attack on website, physical ads\nOther Cybersecurity related topics that worth to assess\n17\nAssessment tool for Elderly Population Cybersecurity Awareness\nBackground and Challenges\nSolutions\nAssessment Tools\nTraining on Elderly Communities\nA smart home design\nA healthy community\nAssessment tools example\nList of Topics\nTimeline and Milestones\nBoard Impacts/Societal benefits\nNo mentor! \nPure Software development!\n18\nYou have freedom on this project!\nFind examples on cybersecurity risks and attacks.\nApply features on your app targeting elderly population.\nOpen-source, cross-platform application.\nA full-stack development experience.\nSecurity-oriented development rather than objective-oriented development.\n20\nTimeline – Same for all projects\nMilestone 1: February 25th , each group should provide a research plan document detailing the tasks for each team member in the group. \nMilestone 2: March 18th and March 20th , mid-term evaluation presentation. Each group should present their process so far and plans for the final output in the class. Mentors can choose to join.\nMilestone 3: April 22nd and 24th , final presentation. Each group should present their final outputs to the class. Peer evaluation will be given by professors and students. Mentors should join in the presentation and present together with students. \nMilestone 4: April 29th , final report. Each group should submit a final report of the project including a comprehensive description of the project method, algorithm/modeling details, and evaluation output. Mentors can guide the writing of the report.\n21\nTo generate a software development team\nTeam leader – Project Manager\nUI/UX designer\nFront-end developer\nBack-end developer\nTester/Security Analyst\nWhat is your role?\n22\nAssessment tool for Elderly Population Cybersecurity Awareness\n\nBuild your team today!\n"
