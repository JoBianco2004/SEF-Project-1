Skill level is often quite low sometimes (i.e., script-kiddies) but there are large skilled groups \n\t\t(e.g., Anonymous Group, LulzSec)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Intrusion\n5\nNIST SP 800-61 (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide) List:\nRemote root compromise\nWeb server defacement\nGuessing/cracking passwords\nCopying databases containing credit card numbers\nViewing sensitive data without authorization\nRunning a packet sniffer\nDistributing pirated software\nUsing an unsecured device to access internal network\nImpersonating an executive to get information\nUsing an unattended workstation\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntruder Behavior\n6\nThe techniques and behavior patterns of intruders are constantly shifting, to exploit newly discovered weaknesses and to evade detection and countermeasures\nE.g., they start with a phishing attack that results in the installation of malware that steals login credentials that eventually results in the compromise of a Point-of-Sale terminal\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n7\nSecurity Intrusion: \nUnauthorized act of bypassing the security mechanisms of a system\n\nIntrusion Detection: \nA hardware or software function that gathers and analyzes information from various areas within a computer or a network to identify possible security intrusions\n\nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) / Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs): \nDesigned to aid countering intrusion threats and are reasonably effective against known, less sophisticated attacks (e.g., large-scale email scams)\nThey may not be effective against the more sophisticated, targeted attacks by some criminal or state-sponsored intruders (e.g., new, zero-day exploits)\nThey are part of a defense-in-depth strategy that may also include encryption of sensitive information, detailed audit trails, strong authentication and authorization controls, and active management of application and network security\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDS vs IPS\n8\nIntrusion Detection System\n9\nHost-based IDS (HIDS)\nMonitors the characteristics of a single host and its users for suspicious activity\nNetwork-based IDS (NIDS)\nMonitors network traffic and analyzes network, transport, and application protocols to identify suspicious activity\nDistributed or hybrid IDS\nCombines information from a number of sensors, often both host and network based, in a central analyzer and user interface that is able to better identify and respond to intrusion activity\n\nAnalysis Approaches\n10\nMinimum human supervision\nRecover from crashes and reinitializations\nSelf-monitor and detect intruder modification\nAnomaly detection\nSignature/Heuristic detection\nInvolves the collection of data relating to the behavior of legitimate users over a period of time\nCurrent observed behavior is analyzed to determine whether this behavior is that of a legitimate user or that of an intruder\nCan detect unknown, zero-day attacks, as it starts with known good behavior and identifies anomalies to it – but false alarms are common!\nUses a set of known malicious data patterns or attack rules that are compared with current behavior\nAlso known as misuse detection\nCan only identify known attacks for which it has patterns or rules\nAnomaly Detection Classification Approaches\n11\nMinimum human supervision\nRecover from crashes and reinitializations\nSelf-monitor and detect intruder modification\nTwo key issues that affect the relative performance of these alternatives are: (i) the efficiency/effectiveness, and (ii) cost of the detection process\nMachine Learning Approaches Proposed for an IDS\n12\nMinimum human supervision\nRecover from crashes and reinitializations\nSelf-monitor and detect intruder modification\nBayesian networks:  Encode probabilistic relationships among observed metrics\n\nMarkov models:  Develop a model with sets of states, some possibly hidden, interconnected by transition probabilities\n\nNeural networks:  Simulate human brain operation with neurons and synapse between them, that classify observed data\n\nFuzzy logic:  Uses fuzzy set theory where reasoning is approximate, and can accommodate uncertainty\n\nGenetic algorithms:  Uses techniques inspired by evolutionary biology, including inheritance, mutation, selection and recombination, to develop classification rules\n\nClustering and outlier detection:  Group the observed data into clusters based on some similarity or distance measure, and then identify subsequent data as either belonging to a cluster or as an outlier\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Security Tools\nWireshark - monitors all information entering and leaving the computer\n\n\nSnort – highly configurable and portable host-based and network-based IDS; detects intrusions into the system and logs them for further examination on servers & networks\nhttp://www.wireshark.org \n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.snort.org \n13\n14\nNetwork, IoT, and Cybersecurity Lab \n(EagleCyberNest @ HE 303)\nIs Hiring!!!\n15\nNetwork, IoT, and Cybersecurity Research Lab \u000b\nWe’re the 1st student research lab focus on network and cybersecurity in the computing and software engineering department!!!\nThis research job counts for FGCU service-learning hours!\nWe have tons of network devices and resources (e.g., routers, switches, racks, high-speed network)!!!\nWe even have drones!\nCome and join us!
