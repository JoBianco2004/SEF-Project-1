see the next slide for an example\n\n8\nWork Breakdown Structure\n9\nStandards\nEvery engineering discipline has specific standards\nStandards in the cybersecurity industry include:\nRMF: Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework\nISO 27001: Standard for Information Security Management System (ISMS)\nISO 27004: How to Measure Information Security\nNIST SP 800-63B: Digital Identity Guidelines\n10\nModeling\nCybersecurity engineering is directed toward some threat\nModeling ensures you are building your security to counter the threats specific to your systems\nDifferent modeling concepts include:\nSTRIDE: Identifies threats in six categories\nPASTA: Risk-centric seven-step methodology\nDREAD: Mnemonic for risk rating using five categories (Outdated)\n\n11\nSummary\nThere are various applications of systems engineering to cybersecurity\nThe goal is to apply a methodical, systematic approach to cybersecurity\nPenetration testing should be a carefully engineered process mapped to specific testing requirements\nIt is beneficial to model cybersecurity scenarios to better understand system security requirements\n12\nModule 3 – Defense Architectures and Design\n\nNetwork Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning\nDigital Forensics\nCybersecurity Engineering\nSecurity policies\nFirewalls\nAuthentication, Access controls\nFederated trust\nIoT/Cloud middleware\nIT Security Management Controls\n13\nSecurity Control\n14\nControl is defined as:\n\n“An action, device, procedure, or other measure that reduces risk by eliminating or preventing a security violation, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it to enable corrective action.”\n\n\nControl Classifications\n15\nManagement controls\nFocus on security policies, planning, guidelines, and standards that influence the selection of operational and technical controls to reduce the risk of loss and to protect the organization’s mission\nThese controls refer to issues that management needs to address\nOperational controls\nAddress the correct implementation and use of security policies and standards, ensuring consistency in security operations and correcting identified operational deficiencies\nThese controls relate to mechanisms and procedures that are primarily implemented by people rather than systems\nThey are used to improve the security of a system or group of systems\nTechnical controls\nInvolve the security policies on correct use of hardware and software security capabilities in systems\nThese range from simple to complex measures that work together to secure critical and sensitive data, information, and IT systems functions\n\nNIST SP800-53 Security Controls \n16\nDetailed Security Controls \n17\nDetailed Security Controls (2) \n18\nDetailed Security Controls (3) \n19\nTechnical Security Controls\n20\nIT Security Plan\n21\nProvides details of:\nWhat will be done\nWhat resources are needed\nWho is responsible\nGoal is to detail the actions needed to improve the identified deficiencies in the risk profile\n\n\nSecurity Plan Implementation\n22\nSecurity Plan Implementation (2)\n23\nSecurity Plan Implementation Follow-up\n24\nSecurity management is a cyclic process\nConstantly repeated to respond to changes in the IT systems and the risk environment\nNeed to monitor implemented controls\nEvaluate changes for security implications\t\nOtherwise increase chance of security breach\nSecurity Plan Maintenance\n25\nNeed continued maintenance and monitoring of implemented controls to ensure continued correct functioning and appropriateness\nGoal is to ensure controls perform as intended\n\n\n"
