It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts a user account and authorizing third-party applications to access that user account. OAuth 2 provides authorization flows for web and desktop applications, as well as mobile devices. OAuth Roles OAuth defines four roles: Resource Owner: The resource owner is the user who authorizes an application to access their account. The application\u2019s access to the user\u2019s account is limited to the scope of the authorization granted (e.g. read or write access) Client: The client is the application that wants to access the user\u2019s account.

Utilize SDN functionality for multiple virtual networks and multiple cloud accounts/segments to enhance network isolation. Independent accounts and virtual networks greatly limit the scope of harm compared to traditional data centers. Implement default deny on cloud firewalls. Base cloud firewall policies on each workload rather than per network application. Use cloud firewall policies to restrict communication between workloads within the same virtual subnet as much as possible, such as using security groups. 141 Suggestions on Fundamental Resources Store logs externally from the workload. Understand and comply with the cloud provider's limitations on vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. Disable remote access. Integrate security testing into the image creation process. Set up alerts and file integrity monitoring. Patch by updating images rather than directly patching running instances. Select security agents that are cloud-aware and minimize performance impact. Maintain security controls for long-running workloads using tools that can identify the cloud environment. 142 Suggestions on Management Plane Ensure that API gateways and web consoles have sufficient perimeter security. Utilize strong authentication and multi-factor authentication. Strictly control the credentials of the main account holder/root account and consider dual authorization access to them.

For developers, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having to build a complete firmware around it; for users, this means the ability for full customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned. OpenWrt is a highly extensible GNU/Linux distribution for embedded devices (typically wireless routers). Unlike many other distributions for these routers, OpenWrt is built from the ground up to be a full-featured, easily modifiable operating system for your router. In practice, this means that you can have all the features you need with none of the bloat, powered by a Linux kernel that's more recent than most other distributions. In this Lab, we will use a router called GL-MT300N-V2 which has OpenWrt pre-installed. This router is small, light and easy to use. Some hacker may use this kind of router on the public environment such as a coffee store, shopping mall, airport, etc to mark a free wi-fi network and achieve user\u2019s information and password. 3.2. Getting started with OpenWrt Power up the router and wait for few seconds. Once orange color light up you will have the default WiFi network up and running. Figure 1: Examples on connecting with router Wi-Fi network Default WiFi password is written on the back of the mini router. Once you are connected to the network, use the default IP address written on the back of the mini router to access the management console. -3- After language, country selection, and setting admin password, you will get the simplified ad min console for GL.iNet.

If you are using your mobile phone as a personal hotspot, you may disconnect with any Wi-Fi network use LTE/4G as the network connection. Notice: You may not successfully connect to the internet as a repeater through Eagle-WiFi since it needs to be accessed through username and password. When you successfully connected with one Wi-Fi, refresh the website and you will see the \u2018internet connection\u2019 bar has changed from blank to an IP address setting on it and if you click on that, you will find the detailed information on repeater connection.

If you are using mobile devices on repeater connection, be aware of mobile data use. Sometimes the operating system will automatically switch to an Internet-accessible Wi-Fi network. So make sure your repeatable Wi-Fi has Internet access all the time and you are always connecting on the Wi-Fi by the router. 3.3. Analyzing network traffic with OpenWrt In this section, we will SSH to OpenWrt installed router and use software such as tcpdump and Wireshark to analyze network traffic. Step 1: SSH to the router. In this step, you can use whether windows PuTTY or Linux/Unix based system to SSH to the router i.e. Kali system. If you are using windows system, download PuTTY from the website (Choose MSI (\u2018Windows Installer\u2019) -> 64-bit or 32-bit) and install. Open PuTTY,"

You will then successfully SSH to the router. If you are using Kali, make sure to configure the network interface to Bridge. Figure 4: Example on successfully using PuTTY on Windows SSH to the router -5- Warning: These approaches might specially come in handy when you need to analyze packets generated by mobile devices. It could be a great setup to analyze how an Android device infected with a malware, behaves and communicates with external components. In addition, a similar setup can also be used to perform a passive man in the middle attack. This is why it is generally advised not to use public WiFi networks unless you are protected with a VPN (or at least trusted SSL/TSL connections). Step 2: Analyzing network traffic with remote Wireshark listener In this section, you will use the Kali VM system and Wireshark in Kali to analysis the network traffic in your laptop. Following three steps are setups before analyzing. First, open your Kali system and make sure the network adapter is in \u201cBridge\u201d mode. Second, run \u201cdhclient\u201d on the command line to refresh the network settings and make sure your Kali system has an updated IP address in the same network of your laptop and your router. Third, mark down all the IP address of these three devices. Following is an example: \u2022 OpenWrt Router: 192.168.8.1 \u2022 My laptop device: 192.168.8.226 (Victim, check your ipconfig/ifconfig under Wi-fi) \u2022 Kali system with Wireshark: 192.168.8.181 (attacker, check this as well) Once you finish setting up all the IP address, we can use the following commands to analysis on Wireshark. 1.

This section is used on how to use a storage device (USB or sata or sdcard or whatever) to expand your LEDE device's space in root filesystem, to install freely all the packages you need. Background Info: -7- In most supported devices, the LEDE firmware splits the internal storage into two partitions \u2022 \u201croot filesystem\u201d (/), a highly-compressed read-only partition \u2022 \u201coverlay\u201d (/overlay), a second partition that is writable The overlay partition is merged with the root filesystem using the overlayfs (a feature of linux kernel), showing a single \u201cwhole\u201d read-write filesystem to applications. This way LEDE fits even in tiny amounts of internal storage (as low as 4 MiB) but still allows to write settings and install some packages in the writable partition without changing all Linux programs used. Extroot, also known as rootfs on external storage, works by setting another overlay partition in the external storage device, and during boot, this new overlay partition will be mounted over the internal storage's overlay partition. This approach allows easy fallback in case the external storage device is removed, as your LEDE device will still have its own overlay partition and thus will load all configuration from there. Which means that it will behave exactly the same as just before you set up extroot. Step 1: From the command line interface write (on a single line): $ opkg update && opkg install block-mount kmod-fs-ext4 kmod-usb- storage e2fsprogs kmod-usb-ohci kmod-usb-uhci fdisk This installs packages needed for a partition with the ext4 filesystem (and doesn't install packages for the f2fs filesystem). Step 2: Run command \u201cfdisk -l\u201d to check which part is the major storage section on your USB disk. Your USB device may only have one partition, so make sure to use your own"

The DNS server sends a UDP response packet including the IP address. The attacker sends a query to the DNS server with a spoofed IP source address of j.k.l.m; this is the IP address of the target. The attacker uses port 7, which is usually associated with echo, a reflector service. The DNS server then sends a response to the victim of the attack, j.k.l.m, addressed to port 7. If the victim is offering the echo service, it may create a packet that echoes the received data back to the DNS server. This can cause a loop between the DNS server and the victim. Amplification Attacks 92 They are a variant of reflector attacks and also involve sending a packet with a spoofed source address for the target system to intermediaries They differ in generating multiple response packets for each original packet sent; this can be achieved by directing the original request to the broadcast address for some network; as a result, all hosts on that network can potentially respond to the request, generating a flood of responses to a victim (spoofed) IP address It is only necessary to use a service handled by large numbers of hosts on the intermediate network; the well-known Smurf DoS program used ping flood mechanism using ICMP echo request packets The best additional defense against this form of attack is to"

Consider an attack using ICMP echo request (ping) packets that are 500 bytes in size (ignoring framing overhead). How many of these packets per second must the attacker send to flood a target organization using a 0.5-Mbps link? How many per second if the attacker uses a 2-Mbps link? Or a10-Mbps link? Answers to Q1 Let\u2019s have the following parameters: w the bandwidth of the communications channel, and p the minimum number of 500-byte size packets needed to exceed the capacity of the channel. To reach the capacity of the channel (p * 500 * 8) = w, with w expressed in bits, so p = w/4000. Based on it for each case we have: w = 0.5 Mbps = 500,000 bits; p = 500000/4000 = 125 packets/second w = 2.0 Mbps = 2,000,000 bits; p = 2000000/4000 = 500 packets/second w = 10.0 Mbps = 10,000,000 bits; p = 10000000/4000 = 2,500 packets/second In-Class Practice Question 2: Consider a distributed variant of the attack we explore in Problem Q1.

How many such zombie systems would the attacker need to flood a target organization using a 0.5-Mbps link? A 2-Mbps link? Or a10-Mbps link? Given reports of botnets composed of many thousands of zombie systems, what can you conclude about their controller\u2019s ability to launch DDoS attacks on multiple such organizations simultaneously? Or on a major organization with multiple, much larger network links than we have considered in these problems? Answers to Q2 Let\u2019s have the following parameters: w the bandwidth of the communications channel, and p the minimum number of 500-byte size packets needed to exceed the capacity of the channel, and z the number of zombies needed to exceed the capacity of the channel. The maximum number of packets a zombie can send is pz = 128,000/4000 =32 pps (packets per second). Based on the results from Q2, the number of required zombies will be z = p/pz = p/32, and for each case we have: w = 0.5 Mbps; z = 125pps/32pps = 3,9 (requires 4 zombies) w = 2.0 Mbps; z = 500pps/32pps = 15,6 (requires 16 zombies) w = 10.0 Mbps; z = 2500pps/32pps = 78,1 (requires 79 zombies) Based on the results we got above, it suggests that just a few zombies with relatively low capacity communication channel will be able to cause problems to organizations. In the examples above, with corporate bandwidth from 0.5Mbps to 10Mbps, we have a very narrow channel for today\u2019s standards, however the number of zombies required to shut those networks down is small compared with the thousands of zombies that a botnet controller could use."

If the botnet controller manages to increase the size of the packet the attack will be even more effective. In-Class Practices Question 3: All the information that a server needs to know about a connection is not only contained in the SYN packet, but also in the final ACK packet from the client. Therefore, information-wise, there is no need to allocate a buffer to save the information about half-open connections. If we get rid of this buffer, the SYN flooding attack will not be effective any more. Do you agree with such a statement or not. Please justify your answer. Answers to Q3 Basically, if we get rid of the buffer, we have solved the SYN flooding attack problem, but we will introduce a new and more powerful attack. The attacker can simply send ACK flooding packets, each one causing the server to allocate memory for a full connection, which takes more memory than that for half-open connections. 130 Module 2 TCP fundamental Attacks on the TCP protocol Denial-of-Service attack SQL injection attack Cross-side scripting attack Miscellaneous: Heartbleed bug and attack, Ransomware, Cryptojacking The Heartbleed Bug and Attack 131 Vulnerability in the OpenSSL library, specifically the Heartbeat protocol in TLS (Transport Layer Security) OpenSSL (widely used library for TLS) drives HTTPS that your web browser relies on for online banking, and other secure transactions Launched in 2012 on web servers built on top of OpenSSL Disclosed in 2014 Background: the Heartbeat Protocol 132 TLS/SSL protocols provide a secure channel between two communicating applications Heartbeat extension: implement keep-alive feature of TLS Maintains secure session without interruption (e.g., from firewall) when client and"

Challenges exist to secure the communication in collaborative drone services in terms of privacy leakage, data confidentiality protection, and the lack of development and implementation of mechanisms for reliable and secure protocols [6].

Same as Client Program. Step 2 : Bind to a port number. An application that communicates with others over the network needs to register a port number on its host computer. When the packet arrives, the operating system knows which application is the receiver based on the port number. The server needs to tell the OS which port it is using. This is done via the bind() system call 6 TCP Server Program Step 3 : Listen for connections. After the socket is set up, TCP programs call listen() to wait for connections It tells the system that it is ready to receive connection requests. Once a connection request is received, the operating system will go through the 3-way handshake to establish the connection The established connection is placed in the queue, waiting for the application to take it.

The attacker sends a query to the DNS server with a spoofed IP source address of j.k.l.m; this is the IP address of the target.

If the victim is offering the echo service, it may create a packet that echoes the received data back to the DNS server. This can cause a loop between the DNS server and the victim. Amplification Attacks 56 They are a variant of reflector attacks and also involve sending a packet with a spoofed source address for the target system to intermediaries They differ in generating multiple response packets for each original packet sent; this can be achieved by directing the original request to the broadcast address for some network; as a result, all hosts on that network can potentially respond to the request, generating a flood of responses to a victim (spoofed) IP address It is only necessary to use a service handled by large numbers of hosts on the intermediate network; the well-known Smurf DoS program used ping flood mechanism using ICMP echo request packets The best additional defense against this form of attack is to not allow directed broadcasts to be routed into a network from outside Amplification Attacks cont. 57 Smurf Attack DNS Amplification Attack 58 Use packets directed at a legitimate DNS server as the intermediary system Attacker creates a series of DNS requests containing the spoofed source address of the target system Exploit DNS behavior to convert a small request to a much larger response (amplification) Target is flooded with"

Answers to Q2 Let\u2019s have the following parameters: w the bandwidth of the communications channel, and p the minimum number of 500-byte size packets needed to exceed the capacity of the channel, and z the number of zombies needed to exceed the capacity of the channel. The maximum number of packets a zombie can send is pz = 128,000/4000 =32 pps (packets per second). Based on the results from Q2, the number of required zombies will be z = p/pz = p/32, and for each case we have: w = 0.5 Mbps; z = 125pps/32pps = 3,9 (requires 4 zombies) w = 2.0 Mbps; z = 500pps/32pps = 15,6 (requires 16 zombies) w = 10.0 Mbps; z = 2500pps/32pps = 78,1 (requires 79 zombies) Based on the results we got above, it suggests that just a few zombies with relatively low capacity communication channel will be able to cause problems to organizations. In the examples above, with corporate bandwidth from 0.5Mbps to 10Mbps, we have a very narrow channel for today\u2019s standards, however the number of zombies required to shut those networks down is small compared with the thousands of zombies that a botnet controller could use. With thousands of zombies conducting flooding DoS attacks, a botnet controller will be able to attack many organizations at the same time or a big organization with multiple links. If the botnet controller manages to increase the size of the packet the attack will be even more effective. In-Class Practices Question 3: All the information that a server needs to know about a connection is not only contained in the SYN packet, but also in the final ACK packet from the client. Therefore, information-wise, there is no"

Do you agree with such a statement or not. Please justify your answer. Answers to Q3 Basically, if we get rid of the buffer, we have solved the SYN flooding attack problem, but we will introduce a new and more powerful attack. The attacker can simply send ACK flooding packets, each one causing the server to allocate memory for a full connection, which takes more memory than that for half-open connections. 112 Module 2 TCP fundamental Attacks on the TCP protocol Denial-of-Service attack SQL injection attack Cross-side scripting attack Miscellaneous: Heartbleed bug and attack, Ransomware, Cryptojacking The Heartbleed Bug and Attack 113 Vulnerability in the OpenSSL library, specifically the Heartbeat protocol in TLS (Transport Layer Security) OpenSSL (widely used library for TLS) drives HTTPS that your web browser relies on for online banking, and other secure transactions Launched in 2012 on web servers built on top of OpenSSL Disclosed in 2014 Background: the Heartbeat Protocol 114 TLS/SSL protocols provide a secure channel between two communicating applications Heartbeat extension: implement keep-alive feature of TLS Maintains secure session without interruption (e.g., from firewall) when client and server are not sending data to each other for a period of time Hard to initiate and re-establish secure sessions Send request packet to receiver and obtain an acknowledgement packet by doing a copy of the payload content based on payload length L The copy caused the vulnerability; attacker can specify larger L Heartbleed bug is an implementation flaw in TLS/SSL heartbeat extension How Response Packet is Constructed 115 Problem: how much is copied depends on the value contained in the payload length field What if this"

These apps became a popular target of session hijackers, even earning the nickname \u2018zoom bombing\u2019. There were news reports of session hijackers joining private video sessions, in some cases shouting profanities, hateful language and sharing pornographic images. In response, Zoom introduced greater privacy protections to minimize the risk. Slack In 2019, a researcher on a bug bounty platform identified a vulnerability in Slack which allowed attackers to force users into fake session redirects so they could steal their session cookies. This gave attackers access to any data shared within Slack (which for many organizations, can be significant). Slack was quick to respond and patched the vulnerability within 24 hours of the researcher highlighting it. 25 Defending Against Session Hijacking Making it difficult for attackers to spoof packets Randomize source port number Randomize initial sequence number Note: Randomization is NOT effective against local attacks that can sniff packets and determine this information Encrypting payload 26 27 Module 2 TCP fundamental Attacks on the TCP protocol Denial-of-Service attack SQL injection attack Cross-side scripting attack Miscellaneous: Heartbleed bug and attack, Ransomware, Cryptojacking Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack 28 A denial of service (DoS) is an action that prevents or impairs the authorized use of networks, systems, or"

Consider an attack using ICMP echo request (ping) packets that are 500 bytes in size (ignoring framing overhead). How many of these packets per second must the attacker send to flood a target organization using a 0.5-Mbps link? How many per second if the attacker uses a 2-Mbps link? Or a10-Mbps link? Answers to Q1 Let\u2019s have the following parameters: w the bandwidth of the communications channel, and p the minimum number of 500-byte size packets needed to exceed the capacity of the channel. To reach the capacity of the channel (p * 500 * 8) = w, with w expressed in bits, so p = w/4000. Based on it for each case we have: w = 0.5 Mbps = 500,000 bits; p = 500000/4000 = 125 packets/second w = 2.0 Mbps = 2,000,000 bits; p = 2000000/4000 = 500 packets/second w = 10.0 Mbps = 10,000,000 bits; p = 10000000/4000 = 2,500 packets/second In-Class Practice Question 2: Consider a distributed variant of the attack we explore in Problem Q1. Assume the attacker has compromised a number of broadband-connected residential PCs to use as zombie systems. Also assume each such system has an average uplink capacity of 128 kbps. What is the maximum number of 500-byte ICMP echo request (ping) packets a single zombie PC can send per second? How many such zombie systems would the attacker need to flood a target organization using a 0.5-Mbps link? A 2-Mbps link? Or a10-Mbps link?

Answers to Q2 Let\u2019s have the following parameters: w the bandwidth of the communications channel, and p the minimum number of 500-byte size packets needed to exceed the capacity of the channel, and z the number of zombies needed to exceed the capacity of the channel. The maximum number of packets a zombie can send is pz = 128,000/4000 =32 pps (packets per second).

In the examples above, with corporate bandwidth from 0.5Mbps to 10Mbps, we have a very narrow channel for today\u2019s standards, however the number of zombies required to shut those networks down is small compared with the thousands of zombies that a botnet controller could use. With thousands of zombies conducting flooding DoS attacks, a botnet controller will be able to attack many organizations at the same time or a big organization with multiple links. If the botnet controller manages to increase the size of the packet the attack will be even more effective. In-Class Practices Question 3: All the information that a server needs to know about a connection is not only contained in the SYN packet, but also in the final ACK"

If we get rid of this buffer, the SYN flooding attack will not be effective any more. Do you agree with such a statement or not. Please justify your answer. Answers to Q3 Basically, if we get rid of the buffer, we have solved the SYN flooding attack problem, but we will introduce a new and more powerful attack. The attacker can simply send ACK flooding packets, each one causing the server to allocate memory for a full connection, which takes more memory than that for half-open connections."

Attack Launch 6 Attack Results: Some data from the server\u2019s memory also got copied into the response packet, which will be sent out Attack Launch 7 To launch a Heartbleed attack, an attacked sends a specially crafted Heartbeat request packet to the victim Inside this packet, the number put in the payload size field is larger than the actual payload size When the packet arrives on receiver side, memcpy() will copy more data into the response packet than the request packet"

Rule 4 allows external traffic to any destination port above 1023. As an example of an exploit of this rule, an external attacker can open a connection from the attacker\u2019s port 5150 to an internal Web proxy server on port 8080. This is supposed to be forbidden and could allow an attack on the server. To counter this attack, the firewall rule set can be configured with a source port field for each row.

OAuth 2 is an authorization framework that enables applications \u2014 such as Facebook, GitHub, and DigitalOcean \u2014 to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts a user account and authorizing third-party applications to access that user account. OAuth 2 provides authorization flows for web and desktop applications, as well as mobile devices. OAuth Roles OAuth defines four roles: Resource Owner: The resource owner is the user who authorizes an application to access their account. The application\u2019s access to the user\u2019s account is limited to the scope of the authorization granted (e.g. read or write access) Client: The client is the application that wants to access the user\u2019s account. Before it may do so, it must be authorized by the user, and the authorization must be validated by the API. Resource Server: The resource server hosts the protected user accounts.

User B has read access rights to file 1, and so on. Access Control Lists 10 The access matrix may be decomposed by columns, yielding access control lists (ACLs) For each object, an ACL lists users and their permitted access rights. The ACL may contain a default, or public, entry. This allows users that are not explicitly listed as having special rights to have a default set of rights. The default set of rights should always follow the rule of least privilege or read-only access, whichever is applicable. Elements of the list may include individual users as well as groups of users. Extended Access Control Matrix 11 To represent the protection state, we extend the universe of objects in the access control matrix to include the following: Processes: Access rights include the ability to delete a process, stop (block), and wake up a process Devices: Access rights include the ability to read/write the device, to control its operation (e.g., a disk seek), and to block/unblock the device for use Memory locations or regions: Access rights include the ability to read/write certain regions of memory that are protected such that the default is to disallow access Subjects: Access rights with respect to a subject have to do with the ability to grantor delete access rights of that subject to other objects, as explained subsequently Role-Based Access Control 12 Traditional DAC systems define the access rights of individual users and groups of users"

OAuth 2 is an authorization framework that enables applications \u2014 such as Facebook, GitHub, and DigitalOcean \u2014 to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts a user account and authorizing third-party applications to access that user account. OAuth 2 provides authorization flows for web and desktop applications, as well as mobile devices. OAuth Roles OAuth defines four roles: Resource Owner: The resource owner is the user who authorizes an application to access their account. The application\u2019s access to the user\u2019s account is limited to the scope of the authorization granted (e.g. read or write access) Client: The client is the application that wants to access the user\u2019s account. Before it may do so, it must be authorized by the user, and the authorization must be validated by the API. Resource Server: The resource server hosts the protected user accounts. Authorization Server: The authorization server verifies the identity of the user then issues access tokens to the application. OAuth Steps OAuth service steps Application Registration Application Name Application Website Redirect URI or Callback URL Authorization Grant \u2013 Various Types Authorization Code: used with server-side Applications Client Credentials: used with Applications that have API access Device Code: used for devices that lack browsers or have input limitations Most used Grant Type: Authorization Code 28 Module 3 \u2013 Defense Architectures and Design Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning Digital Forensics Cybersecurity Engineering Security policies Firewalls Authentication, Access controls Federated trust IoT/Cloud middleware Lightweight and Flexible Security for IoT-based Smart City Applications Recreated disaster scenes of tornado damages (in Joplin, MO 2011) at the: (a) Joplin High School; (b) Joplin Hospital 29 Lightweight and Flexible Security for IoT-based Smart City Applications IoT Gateway Middleware that"

Applications and commodity computing resources (storage, CPU, networking, etc.) are separated in the cloud model. So the idea of managing actually servers and provisioning storage and dealing with network connectivity is no longer an issue. Another aspect of cloud computing is flexibility, since computing resources are organized into \u201cpools\u201d this allows customers to buy what they need. However they want to buy it. These so-called pools can be instantly provisioned and rolled-out (or deprovisioned and taken offline) meaning there aren\u2019t constraints to how quickly the infrastructure can be changed. Cloud resources can be scaled up and/or down with ease, providing a customer the ability to scale their environment based on usage, not"

However, other areas of the IoT market are growing rapidly. 50 Benefits of IoT IoT offers a number of benefits to organizations, enabling them to: Monitor their overall business processes; Improve the customer experience; Save time and money; Enhance employee productivity; Integrate and adapt business models; Make better business decisions; and Generate more revenue. 51 The smart world of the future \u2013 using Iot Source: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/05/13/simple-explanation-internet-things-that-anyone-can-understand/#ef2433f1d091 52 Smart farming: Use of iot to improve agriculture In IoT-based smart farming, a system is built for monitoring the crop field with the help of sensors (light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, etc.) and automating the irrigation system. The farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere. This is highly efficient compared to the traditional/conventional approach. In terms of environmental issues, IoT-based smart farming provides great benefits including: better and efficient water usage, and optimization of inputs and treatments. Therefore, smart farming based on IoT technologies enables growers and farmers to reduce waste and enhance productivity. Some of the IoT applications in this area are: Precision farming Agricultural drones Livestock monitoring Smart greenhouses 53 Industrial Iot (iiot) Industrial IoT (IIoT) focusses on the use of cyber-physical systems to monitor the physical factory processes and make data-based automated decisions.
